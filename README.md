# 👨🏻‍💻Customer Behavior Data Analyst Portfolio Project

📝 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow — from loading and cleaning data in Python to visualizing insights in Power BI and presenting results professionally.
It highlights data understanding, SQL querying, visualization, and storytelling skills, suitable for both business and technical audiences.

📂 Dataset

Source: .

Content: Contains information about [describe briefly — e.g., customer purchases, sales performance, or movie ratings].

Size: ~[number of rows/columns].

Goal: Derive key insights and trends using analytics techniques.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Category	Tools Used
Programming	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Databases	PostgreSQL, MySQL
Visualization	Power BI
Reporting	Gamma App (for PPT/report creation)
Others	Jupyter Notebook / VS Code, SQL Workbench
🔍 Steps Followed
1. Data Loading & Exploration

Imported dataset using Pandas.

Checked dataset structure, data types, and missing values.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations to find trends and patterns.

2. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values, outliers, and duplicates.

Converted data types and formatted columns for consistency.

Prepared clean dataset for analysis and SQL integration.

3. SQL Integration

Imported cleaned data into PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.

Executed SQL queries for:

Filtering, grouping, and aggregating data.

Joining multiple tables.

Deriving insights using analytical queries.

4. Dashboard Building

Connected Power BI to the cleaned dataset.

Created interactive dashboards showing KPIs and key metrics.

Included filters, charts, and summary visuals for better understanding.

5. Reporting & Presentation
